# Registry Platform — Foundation (Phases 0–3, 5)

The Registry Platform ("Rekisterialusta"), built against the accepted decisions
in `04-decision-record.md`. Real, runnable, tested — not a mock. No build step,
no external services, no dependencies at runtime (Node 22 native type-stripping
+ built-in `node:sqlite`).

## What's here

- **Phase 0** — walking skeleton, stateless handler pattern.
- **Phase 1** — cases/operations data spine, diary numbers, categories.
- **Phase 2** — REST API over `node:http` with one authorization model for
  portals and integrations: two auth systems (customer ownership, worker
  category) plus **API tokens scoped to HTTP method × category** (§7). A
  pluggable identity layer with a dev stub (the D-12 fallback) so real
  eID/OIDC + staff SSO slot in without touching the authorization model.
- **Phase 3** — **forms platform** (case forms with field-subset updates and
  the customer-submission **approval workflow**; operation forms validated
  against a JSON schema, with **file attachments** to a blob store), and the
  **rule engine** (on state change; fixed action catalog + 3 parameterized
  actions; cascade-guarded; every action recorded as an operation).
- **Phase 5** — the multi-registry promise made real: a **second registry
  (Grant) added purely as configuration** on its own database, config-as-code
  (`applyRegistryConfig`) with **dev→test→prod promotion** (versioned config
  artifact), the **management-portal backend** (admin API: add field →
  schema migration, states/transitions, forms, rules, categories, worker
  authorizations, mint/revoke API tokens), and **scheduled CSV exports** across
  all registries with an `export_runs` log.

  (**Phase 4** — message queue + external integrations — is intentionally
  deferred until there is a concrete integration case; rule actions with
  external effects currently record an operation where they will later enqueue.)
- **Web console (MVP)** — a dependency-free vanilla-JS single-page app (in
  `public/`) served by the same HTTP server, exercising all four portals. An
  "Acting as" switch changes the stub-identity bearer so you can watch the two
  auth systems and admin gating behave differently per role. Run `npm run serve`
  and open http://localhost:8080.

- **Internal BIGINT key + public diary number** (D-01/D-02) — `cases.case_key`
  is the surrogate PK; `diary_number` (`REGISTRY/YEAR/NUMBER`) is a unique public
  id, allocated gaplessly per registry+year inside the case-creation transaction.
- **Typed columns from field config** (D-03) — a registry's statutory fields
  become real typed columns via a migration factory, not an EAV bag.
- **Forward-only migration runner** (D-05) — ordered, idempotent, recorded.
- **Integrity in the DBMS** (D-06) — FKs, checks, uniqueness enforced by the DB.
- **Category prefix authorization** (D-09) — hierarchical codes normalized to a
  fixed-width materialized path; a grant on `105` covers `105.04.03` by prefix.
- **Append-only history** — every change is an immutable `operations` row.
- **Single authorization point** — customer ownership + worker category rules
  enforced in the platform core, shared by portals and (later) the REST API.
- **Stateless handler** — the shape every portal/API endpoint will take.

## Run it

Requires Node.js ≥ 22.6 (uses native TypeScript type-stripping and `node:sqlite`).

```bash
npm run demo         # domain-level walkthrough (in-memory DB)
npm run api-demo     # REST walkthrough: auth, forms+approval, rule engine
npm run phase5-demo  # multi-registry, admin edits, config versions, CSV export
npm run serve        # start the HTTP console on :8080. DB chosen by env:
                     #   (default)                → in-memory SQLite + demo seed
                     #   DB_DIR=./data            → on-disk SQLite, persists
                     #   DB_DIALECT=sqlserver ... → SQL Server (see ENVIRONMENTS.md)
                     # load a .env: node --env-file=.env --experimental-strip-types scripts/serve.ts
npm test             # 63 tests: spine, authz, API, forms, rules, HTTP, multi-
                     #   registry, admin, promotion, exports, dialect, db-config
npm run typecheck    # strict tsc --noEmit (needs `npm install` first)
npm run migrate      # apply migrations to data/dev.sqlite
```

`npm run api-demo` opens a case as a citizen, blocks another citizen, stages an
approval-required form change and applies it on worker approval, drives the
lifecycle so a rule auto-closes a paid decision, then reads the published case
through a method+category-scoped API token that is correctly denied write.

## Production notes (next phases)

- The `DbAdapter` interface is the seam for the **SQL Server / oino-ts** adapter
  (D-04) — dev/test stay on SQLite; CI adds SQL Server for fidelity.
- The migration runner is parameterized by registry, ready for the **second
  registry configured-not-coded** (Plan Phase 5).
- Authorization containment is done in code over the small grant set here; in
  production it is pushed into SQL as an indexed `path LIKE grant || '%'` test.
- Deferred by choice: **Phase 4** (message queue + external integrations with
  outbox + idempotency) — waiting for a concrete integration case; rule actions
  with external effects currently record an operation where they will enqueue.
- Not yet built: the management-portal **UI** (the admin *backend* is done);
  **Phase 6** — full authorization test matrix, performance, retention, security
  review. Also pending: the real **SQL Server adapter over oino-ts** (D-04,
  postponed) and the real **identity providers** (D-12; a dev stub is in place).
