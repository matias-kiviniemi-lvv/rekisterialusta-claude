/**
 * End-to-end walking-skeleton demo (Plan Phase 0/2).
 *
 * Runs the whole foundation against an in-memory database and narrates it:
 * migrate → seed a registry → a citizen creates a case → a worker moves it
 * through its lifecycle → authorization is enforced for every actor → the case
 * is published and appears on the public surface. No infrastructure required:
 *   node --experimental-strip-types scripts/demo.ts
