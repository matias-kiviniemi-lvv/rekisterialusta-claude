/**
 * Authorization enforcement (Architecture §6).
 *
 * The ONE place both authorization models live, so portals and the REST API
 * share it (Decision: single enforcement point). Two populations, two rules:
 *   - customers: ownership — must be a party on the case (§6.2), equal rights.
 *   - workers:   category — case category must fall within one of the worker's
 *                grants via prefix containment, with inheritance (§6.3).
 *
 * Both are evaluated as index-friendly SQL prefix tests over the normalized
 * category path, not graph walks.
