/**
 * Walking-skeleton stateless handler (Architecture §1, §13; Plan Phase 0/2).
 *
 * This is the shape every portal/API endpoint takes: a STATELESS function that
 *   1. receives a request with an authenticated actor,
 *   2. authorizes it in the platform core (never trusting the caller),
 *   3. reads/writes domain data through the DbAdapter,
 *   4. returns a plain result — no server-side session state.
 *
 * It holds no state between calls, so it scales horizontally on serverless
 * (Flex Functions). Here it is a plain function; wiring it to an HTTP trigger
 * is an infrastructure detail added in a later phase.
