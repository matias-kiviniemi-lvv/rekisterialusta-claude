/**
 * Declarative registry configuration (config-as-code, Decision D-05).
 *
 * A RegistryConfig fully describes a registry — its statutory fields, lifecycle,
 * forms, and rules — as data. Standing up a new registry is authoring one of
 * these and applying it (services/config-apply.ts); NO application code changes.
 * This is the concrete realization of the platform's core promise: many
 * registries, configured not coded (Plan Phase 5).
 *
 * These objects are the promotable artifact that flows dev → test → prod.
