/**
 * Database adapter abstraction — the single seam isolating the vendor- and
 * runtime-specific database surface (Decisions D-04, D-11).
 *
 * The seam is ASYNC. That is forced by the driver, not by taste: every
 * production-grade SQL Server client for Node (`mssql`/tedious) is asynchronous
 * because it talks over a socket, and there is no synchronous SQL Server driver.
 * Async is also the correct posture on serverless (Flex Functions) where DB I/O
 * must never block the event loop. The dev/test SQLite path (built-in
 * node:sqlite, synchronous) is wrapped to honour the same async contract, so
 * ONE seam serves both dialects and the domain layer is written once.
 *
 *   - Env 1 (offline AI workspace) / dev / CI:  SqliteAdapter — zero runtime
 *       dependencies, no network, no `mssql`.
 *   - Env 2 (local SQL Server) / Env 3 (Azure): SqlServerAdapter over `mssql`,
 *       loaded lazily so it is never required where it is not installed.
 *
 * The platform core and domain services depend ONLY on this interface.
